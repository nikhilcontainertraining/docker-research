create a repository in docker hub
    - the repository name is interactive-joke
    - it can be public pr private
    -

docker push nikhilcontainertraining/interactive-joke
    to the image from local to interactive-joke repository in my docker hub account "nikhilcontainertraining"
    here "nikhilcontainertraining" is dockerhub ID
    if the push returns an error stating "An image does not exist locally with the tag: nikhilcontainertraining/interactive-joke"
        meaning that repo doesn't exists locally and local docker demon is unaware new repo created in remote hub
        hence the repo and/or image needs to created first -OR-
        rename and existing repo with the name "docker_id/repo_name"

docker tag interactive-joke-image:nik1 nikhilcontainertraining/interactive-joke
    to rename and existing repo with the name "docker_id/repo_name"
    this create a CLONE of the image.. it is NOT actually renaming the existing image

docker build -t nikhilcontainertraining/interactive-joke .
    to build new image with required name:tag or just name
    name has to be "docker_id/repo_name" or "docker_id/repo_name:nik1"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

docker pull nikhilcontainertraining/interactive-joke
docker pull nikhilcontainertraining/interactive-joke:nik1
    to pull the prebuild docker image from hub

docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name interactive-joke-container-nik2 nikhilcontainertraining/interactive-joke:nik2
    to pull and run a prebuilt image "nikhilcontainertraining/interactive-joke:nik2"
    the version of the image that is downloaded is "nik2"
    the container is named "interactive-joke-container-nik2"
