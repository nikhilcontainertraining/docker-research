docker run -i image_id/image_name/hash
    for standard input operations with the container during or after container is started

docker run -i -t image_id/image_name
    "t" is for the docker to provide a TTY for interaction

docker run -it image_id/image_name
    the above 2 commands together

docker run -ai image_id/image_name
    to attach with running container in interactive mode

docker run -ait image_id
    to run with "t" during the first run
    if restarting a container with "docker start" then "t" is not required
    docker remembers/memorizes the previously provided input


docker start -it container_id/container_name
    to start the container in interactive mode

docker run -it -a STDIN -p 8080:8080 b75b6f736c00
    to start a container in interactive and terminal mode and attached mode with STDIN(standard input)

docker run -it -a STDIN -a STDOUT -a STDERR -p 8080:8080 b75b6f736c00
    to start a container in interactive and terminal mode and attached mode in either STDIN or/and STDOUT or/add STDERR

---------------------------------------------------------

interactive mode is required when some input to application is feed from terminal
    for example -
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        serverName = reader.readLine();
