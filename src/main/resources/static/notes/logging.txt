docker attach container_id/container_name
    - to attach to a running container
    - if container is stopped returns an error message that container is not running

docker container attach container_id/container_name
    - same as docker attach container_id/name

docker run -p 8080:8080 -d container_id/container_name
    - to run the container in detached mode
    - the application-logs/input/output/error console logs are not streaming in same terminal
    - a detached container can be reattached with docker attach or docker container attach commands

docker logs container_id/container_name
    - to get all the previous logs generated by the container
    - the difference with "attach" statement is attach does not fetch previous logs

docker logs -f container_id/container_name
    - to fetch all the previous logs + [continue streaming]

docker start -a container_id/container_name
    - to start a docker container in attached mode

-------------------------------------------------------------------

docker cp container_name:/app_directory/logs/ /optional_local_directory/logs/

    docker cp friendly_gould:/docker-research-build-own-image/logs/ logs/
        to copy logs file etc.. from container into local directory(logs)
            if local dir "logs" is not present then creates new
                if the commands return "mkdir /logs: read-only file system" error

                    sudo chown -R $(whoami) /logs
                        to give write permissions
