docker attach container_id/container_name
    to attach to a running container
    if container is stopped returns an error message that container is not running

docker container attach container_id/container_name
    same as docker attach container_id/name

docker run -p 8080:8080 -d container_id/container_name
    to run the container in detached mode
    the application-logs/input/output/error console logs are not streaming in same terminal
    a detached container can be reattached with docker attach or docker container attach commands

    to get all the previous logs generated by the container
    the difference with "attach" statement is attach does not fetch previous logs
